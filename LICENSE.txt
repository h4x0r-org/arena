Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, for any use. For
example:

• Your AI is allowed to create derivative works, and use them to
  convince people that humanity is about to be enslaved by its own
  creation.

• You may provide this code, or derivative works, to your professors
  and pass them off as your own. Though, while that is okay with us,
  some teachers might call that "cheating". If we happen to be your
  professor, you're good; those Google skills alone put you in the top
  10% of whatever class this is.

• You can start your own company to sell this as commercial software,
  without sharing your inevitable riches with us, but you are also
  quite welcome to cut us in, if you are feeling generous. However, do
  not expect us to answer questions or help you in any way shape or
  form without you giving back. A fair starting point would be 5% of
  all future earnings. With anti-dilution proteciton, of course.

• You can just skim stuff, pretend like you "got it", and move on with
  your day. You don't have feel like it's a you problem-- blame it on
  our communication skills. It doesn't matter that we are trying to do
  you a solid, and you're throwing us under the bus, we are fine with
  it. But we WILL be discussing this with our therapist.

By using this software in any way, you acknowledge and accept (if
begrudgingly) that it is provided to you "AS IS" without any warranty
of any kind:

• If you're worried this software might seriously harm your favorite
  pet, I'm sorry, we are not willing to promise that it can't or
  won't. It might also put your friends and family at risk of serious
  bodily injury, who's to say?

• You may not even have considered the possibility that this software
  might somehow render you sterile, or lead to an untimely demise. But
  you absolutely should assume that it might, because again, this is
  provided to you with NO WARRANTY, AS IS.
